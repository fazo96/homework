# Homework
Schoolwork management application for students. Built using
[Meteor](http://github.com/meteor/meteor), a Web App framework on top of Node.js
and MongoDB.

I built this because I felt like the other apps didn't do it very well.
Also, I learnt a lot and had fun!

### Try it
[the app is hosted online!](http://homework.meteor.com)

### Development
Clone the repo, [install meteor](http://meteor.com), `cd` to the directory
then run `meteor`.

That's it.

If you want to send emails (necessary to confirm users) you need to set the
`MAIL_URL` environment variable, or else the emails will just be printed on
stdout. The process is
[explained on the Meteor docs](http://docs.meteor.com/#email)
